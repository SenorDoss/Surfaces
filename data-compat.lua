Pre-init mod compatibility stuff, array to be passed in format "index = data" where:
	- index should be the mod name as described by the specific mod string
	- data should be a boolean, may be a result of tests or otherwise passed simply as true or false

-- compat.insert and compat.insert_data are not the same function, compat.insert may only be called after the game is loaded, meanwhile compat.insert_data will work in the data loading phases
